# Recoil Hacks
 My experiments with hacking and modifying recoil. All builds were compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 and anything past that will fail.


 # Current Contents
- Recoil OpenWRT images(Builds I have compiled of the recoil game hub source code.)
- recoil_001*.ipk file that gets uploaded to the hub when the app updates it.(Not extracted by me.)
- recoil.ipk Really not sure what this is from I'm updating this a year later.
